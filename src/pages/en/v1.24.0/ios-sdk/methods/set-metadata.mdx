With this method, you can set the value of one of the metadata fields configured on the OpenReplay platform.

<Aside type="note">
	You may call this method as many times as you wish, just keep in mind that if you use the same `key` attribute, the last value you passed will be saved in the platform. All previous values will be lost.
</Aside>

See [metadata](/installation/metadata) for more details. 

## Signature

ORTracker.shared.setMetadata(key: String, value: String)
```

## Parameters
