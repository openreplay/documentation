You can also deploy from [source](/deployment/deploy-source). Even though this method takes more effort, it gives a lot of flexibility as you can use the latest code and customize it if needed.

{/* - [Administer OpenReplay](/deployment/openreplay-admin): For easy management of your instance by directly accessing logs, reinstalling services, increasing capacity and more.
- [Upgrade Deployment](/deployment/upgrade): Keep your OpenReplay instance updated by upgrading it to the latest version.
