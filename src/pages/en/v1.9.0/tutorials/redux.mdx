If you need extra visibility when replaying your users’ sessions, getting a glimpse into the application state can be very helpful.

In the case of Redux, OpenReplay [provides a plugin](https://docs.openreplay.com/plugins/redux) that allows you to integrate into the internal workings of the store. This plugin will let you see the state (no pun intended!) of the Redux store and the actions dispatched throughout the recorded session.

Once set up, you should be able to watch changes in the store as seen in the following screenshot:

## Setting up the Redux on a Next.js project

For this tutorial, we’ll use [this repository](https://github.com/deleteman/nextjs-commerce-example/tree/redux-store) (branch **redux-store**) of a generic e-commerce site built with Next.js.

In this project, we will replace a set of highlighted products with a set of new ones taken from an external API.

For that, we’ll add a function to request the products using Axios, and we’ll do it from within a Redux action.

**Note:** This is a complex Next.js application, so it might not follow the standard structure found inside the classic To-Do apps, but following this tutorial you should be able to keep up with the changes.

**Remember:** you can always clone the repo and review the code yourself.

We’ll start installing all main dependencies with:

```bash
npm i next-redux-wrapper redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-devtools-extension
```

With that out of the way, create a folder called `store` in  your project’s root directory and reproduce the following structure:

![Folder structure](/images/folder-structure.png)

The `types.js` file will contain the type definition for the two actions we’re going to be defining:

```bash
export const GET_PRODUCTS = 'GET_PRODUCTS'
export const PRODUCTS_ERROR = 'PRODUCTS_ERROR'
```

The `store.js` file will export a function that, WHEN called, will create a new Redux store. That is because we’ll need to add a new Redux middleware returned by the Redux plugin (more on that in a minute).

```jsx
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension'

import rootReducer from './reducers'

const initalState = {}

export default function createReduxStore(extraMiddleware = []) {
  const middleware = [thunk, ...extraMiddleware]

  const store = createStore(
    rootReducer,
    initalState,
    composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(...middleware))
  )
  return store
}
```

Our reducer file (`makeUpReducer.js`) will update the state with either the list of products or the error message returned when there is a problem.

```jsx
import { GET_PRODUCTS, PRODUCTS_ERROR } from '../types'

const initialState = {
  makeUpProducts: [],
  loading: true,
}

export default function (state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case GET_PRODUCTS:
      return {
        ...state,
        makeUpProducts: action.payload,
        loading: false,
      }
    case PRODUCTS_ERROR:
      return {
        loading: false,
        error: action.payload,
      }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

And finally, the action file will define a single function, taking care of pulling the list of products from an external API and dispatching the right action and payload:

```jsx
import { GET_PRODUCTS, PRODUCTS_ERROR } from '../types'
import axios from 'axios'
import slugify from 'slugify'

export const getMakeUpProducts = () => async (dispatch: any) => {
  console.log('Getting the makeup products')

  try {
    let { data } = await axios.get(
      'https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json?brand=maybelline&apiKey=123fff132'
    )
    const products = data

    let newProds = products.map((p: any) => {
      return {
        id: '' + p.id,
        slug: slugify(p.name),
        name: p.name,
        description: '',
        images: [{ url: p.image_link }],
        variants: [],
        price: {
          value: +p.price,
        },
        options: [],
      }
    })

    dispatch({
      type: GET_PRODUCTS,
      payload: newProds,
    })
  } catch (e) {
    dispatch({
      type: PRODUCTS_ERROR,
      payload: e,
    })
  }
}
```

## Setting up the tracker provider

To inject the tracker into the application, we will use a context provided as shown in the [Next.js tutorial](https://docs.openreplay.com/tutorials/next).

This provider will allow you to configure a set of plugins, in our case, we’ll use the Redux plugin, like this (from within the `_app.tsx` file)

```jsx
//...more imports here....
import TrackerProvider from '../context/trackerProvider'
import trackerRedux from '@openreplay/tracker-redux'

// ... more code here....

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  const Layout = (Component as any).Layout || Noop

  useEffect(() => {
    document.body.classList?.remove('loading')
  }, [])

  let plugins = [
    {
      fn: trackerRedux,
      name: 'redux',
      config: {},
    },
  ]

  return (
    <TrackerProvider config={{ plugins }}>
      <Head />
      <ManagedUIContext>
        <Layout pageProps={pageProps}>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </Layout>
      </ManagedUIContext>
    </TrackerProvider>
  )
}
```

Now, this code allows you to set up the tracker with the right plugin, but for the plugin to work, we’ll need to access the middleware returned when the plugin is called. That means we’ll have to keep track of the returned values of our plugins so they can be used elsewhere. In this case, we’ll need to use it when calling the `createReduxStore` function from above.

To do that, we have to extend the `TrackerProvider` to make sure that we keep the returned value inside the state, like this (you can review the full version of this file [here](https://github.com/deleteman/nextjs-commerce-example/blob/redux-store/site/context/trackerProvider.js)):

```jsx
import { createContext, useCallback } from 'react'
import Tracker from '@openreplay/tracker'
import { v4 as uuidV4 } from 'uuid'
import { useReducer } from 'react'

export const TrackerContext = createContext()
function defaultGetUserId() {
  return uuidV4()
}
function newTracker(config) {
  ///code here
}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'init': {
      if (!state.tracker) {
        console.log('Instantiaing the tracker for the first time...')
        let t = newTracker(state.config)
        let pluginsReturnedValue = {}
        if (state.config.plugins) {
          state.config.plugins.forEach((p) => {
            console.log('Using plugin...')
            pluginsReturnedValue[p.name] = t.use(p.fn(p.config)) //keep track
          })
        }
        return {
          ...state,
          pluginsReturnedValue: pluginsReturnedValue, //update the state
          tracker: t,
        }
      }
      return state
    }
    case 'start': {
      console.log('Starting tracker...')
      state.tracker.start()
      return state
    }
  }
}
export default function TrackerProvider({ children, config = {} }) {
  let [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, {
    tracker: null,
    pluginsReturnedValue: {},
    config,
  })
  let value = {
    startTracking: () => dispatch({ type: 'start' }),
    initTracker: () => dispatch({ type: 'init' }),
    pluginsReturnedValues: { ...state.pluginsReturnedValue }, //inject the state
  }
  return (
    <TrackerContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</TrackerContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

Inside the `init` action, we’re also keeping track of the values returned by the `use` method when called with our plugins. And we’re keeping that dictionary inside the `state.pluginsReturnedValue` property. Which we’re making available to all children through the `pluginsReturnedValues` variable.

That logic allows you to use the plugin when initializing the tracker and then access and use the middleware later.

## Creating the Redux store with the new middleware

Now that we have the plugin working, we need to initialize the Redux store, and we need to do it after the Tracker has been initialized and before the `start` method is called.

For that, I’ve chosen the `ManagedUI` component, which is used directly in the `_app.tsx` file. This component is wrapped by our Tracker Provider, which means it’ll have access to the context we’re sharing.

The component looks like this:

```jsx
export const ManagedUIContext: FC = ({ children }) => {
  const { initTracker, pluginsReturnedValues } = useContext(TrackerContext)
  const [store, setStore] = useState<Store>()

  useEffect(() => {
    initTracker()
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!pluginsReturnedValues['redux']) return
    let middleWares = pluginsReturnedValues['redux']
      ? [pluginsReturnedValues['redux']]
      : []
    setStore(createReduxStore(middleWares))
  }, [pluginsReturnedValues])

  return (
    <div>
      {store && (
        <Provider store={store}>
          <UIProvider>
            <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
          </UIProvider>
        </Provider>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

The key takeaways from this file are:

1. We’re getting the `initTracker` function and the `pluginsReturnedValues` attribute from the context.
2. We’re calling the first one only once, when the component is mounted (through the first `useEffect`).
3. We’re then creating the Redux store only once the `pluginsReturnedValues` variable has our returned value. The second `useEffect` will be called twice, once when the page loads and then when the `initTracker` method modifies our state variable. The second time around, we’ll create the store with the middleware stored in `pluginsReturnedValues`.

## Starting the tracker

With the plugin setup, and the Redux store properly created, all we have to do now, is to call the `start` method from the tracker.

The logic for this will be added into the index.tsx file, and you can take a look at the complete source code of [this file here](https://github.com/deleteman/nextjs-commerce-example/blob/redux-store/site/pages/index.tsx).

The relevant part of this code that we’ll need to take a look is the following:

```jsx
// imports and more logic goes here...

export default function Home({
  products,
}: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {

  const { startTracking } = useContext(TrackerContext)
  const dispatch = useDispatch()
  const makeUpProductsList = useSelector((state: any) => state.makeUpProducts)
  const { makeUpProducts } = makeUpProductsList

  useEffect(() => {
    async function getProds() {
      await startTracking()
      dispatch(getMakeUpProducts() as any)
    }
    getProds()
  }, [dispatch])

  return (
    <>
      <Grid variant="filled">
        {products.slice(0, 3).map((product: any, i: number) => (
          <ProductCard
            key={product.id}
            product={product}
            imgProps={{
              width: i === 0 ? 1080 : 540,
              height: i === 0 ? 1080 : 540,
              priority: true,
            }}
          />
        ))}
      </Grid>
      <Marquee variant="secondary">
        {makeUpProducts.slice(0, 3).map((product: any, i: number) => (
          <ProductCard key={product.id} product={product} variant="slim" />
        ))}
      </Marquee>
      <!-- more code here -->
    </>
  )
}
```

We’re only going to be using the `startTracking` function from the Tracker context provider and the `useSelector` hook from Redux to capture the list of returned products.

The `useEffect` hook will trigger the call to `startTracking` and the retrieval of the new make-up products list by dispatching the `getMakeUpProducts` function call.

And with that, you should be able to deploy your application (provided you’ve configured the API key as mentioned [in this tutorial](https://docs.openreplay.com/tutorials/next))
