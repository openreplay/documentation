Installing the OpenReplay tracker into a Svelte-based project is relatively straightforward.

The key to making it work will be the use of context, which, while it sounds similar to how we do it with Next.js, the implementation will be different.

## SvelteKit and SSR Behavior

As our tracker requires browser context to run, you might need to adjust the "Creating the tracker context" example like shown below to ensure that its imported and created inside client side:

```jsx
<script>
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';

  onMount(async () => {
    if (process.browser) {
			// singleton approach
			const { tracker } = await import('@openreplay/tracker');
			tracker.configure({
				projectKey: "<your project key>", 
        ingestPoint: "https://openreplay.mydomain.com/ingest" // only required if using the self-hosted version of OpenReplay
			});
			tracker.start();
			
			// or you can use a class based approach
      const Tracker = await import('@openreplay/tracker');
      const tracker = new Tracker({
	      projectKey: "", // pKey
	      ingestPoint: "ingestPoint",
      })
      
      tracker.start()
    }
  })
</script>
```

## Sample repo

If you’d like to review the complete code for this project, check out [the repo we’ll be using throughout this tutorial](https://github.com/deleteman/openreplay-svelte-example).

It is a sample SvelteKit application that you can clone and test yourself by following the instructions in the Readme file. Once deployed and configured, you should be able to capture session replays.

## Using Context to share data

This solution will use Svelte’s Context, which allows you to share data between a parent component and all its children (much like React’s Context providers).

In this particular example, we’ll be adding the tracker for the Admin section of our application, so we’ll set the context within the Admin layout file (`src/layout/Admin.svelte`). Then we’ll start it at the first page rendered inside this section.

## Creating the tracker context

Inside the `src/layout/Admin.svelte` file, within the `script` tag, let’s add the following code:

```jsx
import {Tracker, key} from "../context/tracker"

let tracker = new Tracker({
    projectKey: __myapp.env.OPENREPLAY_PROJECT_KEY
});
  
setContext(key, {
 getTracker: () => tracker
} )
```

Of course, you’ll have more code inside this file but what you see above is relevant for us right now.

1. We’re first importing the Tracker from OpenReplay and a key variable (more on these in a second).
2. We’re then instantiating the Tracker. As you can see, the only configuration option we’re using is the project’s key, which you’d get from the UI after setting up the project in OpenReplay.
3. We’re saving the tracker’s instance in the context created by calling `setContext`. The `key` variable will later be used to retrieve this particular value from the context.

<Aside type="tip">
If you’re using the self-hosted version of OpenReplay, you’ll also have to specify the `ingestPoint`configuration property in step 2 (it should point to your domain: `https://openreplay.mydomain.com/ingest`). This property specifies the ingestion endpoint for the tracker’s data.
</Aside>

## Using the tracker context

Using the context (and calling the `start` method) is as simple as getting the context through the `getContext` function from Svelte.

The  context had an object with a function called getTracker , so we’ll  destructure it and call that function.

```jsx
import {key} from "../../context/tracker"
  
let {getTracker} = getContext(key)
onMount( () => {
	let tracker = getTracker()
	tracker.start()
})
```

Afterward, it’s just a matter of calling the `start` method from within the `onMount` callback. We do that to ensure that we’re calling this method from the browser, otherwise the tracker will not work.

## The context/tracker file

We’ve been using this file in both places, so it’s time we take a quick look at it.

This file is exporting two main elements:

1. The `Tracker` class, which we’ve instantiated in the layout file.
2. We’re using the `key` variable to save and retrieve the context.

Here is the content of the file:

```jsx
import Tracker from '@openreplay/tracker'

const key = Symbol("openreplay tracker")

export {Tracker, key}
```

The only interesting bit here is that the `key` variable is not a simple string, it’s actually a `Symbol`. The reason for that is to avoid potential name collisions with other 3rd party libraries that also use the context.

## Taking care of ENV variables

The last thing to review here is how we handle the project’s key, since it should not be hardcoded into your code.

Usually, you’d use an environment variable for this, however since we need that data in the browser and Svelte doesn’t provide an easy way to achieve this, we’ll solve this problem with two packages: [dotevn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) and [@rollup/plugin-replace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-replace).

On one side, we’ll use the dotenv package to gain the ability to define our env variables inside a `.env` file. We’ll define the one we need: 

```jsx
OPENREPLAY_PROJECT_KEY="<YOUR PROJECT KEY>"
```

On the other hand, since we can’t use `dotenv` in our front-end code (because it depends on the `fs` module, which clearly it’s not available in the browser), we’ll use the replace plugin for roll-up. This plugin will replace code in our files for whatever we tell it to. So we’ll configure the plugin to replace the string `“__myapp.env.OPENREPLAY_PROJECT_KEY”` with the actual project key loaded from the `.env` file (thanks to the dotenv package).

To get this done, open the `rollup.config.js` file in the project’s root and add the following code into the `plugins` key.

```jsx
replace({
  "__myapp.env.OPENREPLAY_PROJECT_KEY": `"${process.env.OPENREPLAY_PROJECT_KEY}"`
})
```

This plugin will run in the backend during the bundling process, making it possible for this to work. If you’d like to inspect the full content of this configuration file, you can [check it out here](https://github.com/deleteman/openreplay-svelte-example/blob/main/rollup.config.js).
