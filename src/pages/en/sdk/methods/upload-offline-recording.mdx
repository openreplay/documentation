metaDescription: "Details about the 'uploadOfflineRecording' method from OpenReplay's SDK"
---

This method stops the recording and attempts to start uploading buffered messages to the backend. It has to be awaited in order to make sure that all messages are pushed into service worker.

> Note: The session and events timestamps will be extracted from the user's device, and not synchronised with our backend.

## Signature

```ts
uploadOfflineRecording(): Promise<void>
```

> Use `onSessionSent` hook to trigger any additional actions when the session gets fully uploaded to the backend.
