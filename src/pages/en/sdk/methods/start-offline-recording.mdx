Starts session recording in offline mode (nothing being sent unless triggered to upload) returns methods to control the recording state.

> Note: The session and events timestamps will be extracted from the user's device, and not synchronised with our backend.

## Signature

```ts
startOfflineRecording(
	startOpts?: Partial<StartOptions>, 
	onSessionSent: () => void
): { saveBuffer, getBuffer, setBuffer }
```

### Parameters

With the `startOpts` you can customize different aspects of the recording:
- `userID: string`: Used to manually set the `userID` to track it across sessions. This is a string value and it can be anything you want.
- `metadata: Record<string, string>`: Manually set the metadata values. Check the [Metadata section](/installation/metadata/) to learn more about this feature.
- `forceNew: boolean`: Used to force a new session after page refresh. By default it's set to `false`, so after a refresh the session is kept.
- `sessionHash: string`: Used for sticky sessions. Useful if you have a multi-site application or if you have to redirect the user outside and then back into your site (like to a payment gateway).
- `onSessionSent`: Callback that will be called once session is fully uploaded.


### Return value

- `saveBuffer(): void` - Saves the current buffer to the `localStorage` object (customizable in constructor), buffer will be autoloaded once `startOfflineRecording` is called.
- `getBuffer(): Messages[]` - Returns the current messages buffer.
- `setBuffer(buffer: Messages[])` - Replaces the current buffer with the given one (if you're using alternative temporary saving methods).
