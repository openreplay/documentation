## Private Mode

**Private Mode** is a new setting that blocks all text and sensitive data from being recorded. When enabled, the OpenReplay tracker will not capture any visible text, network data, or console logs. Everything is obscured at the source—so nothing sensitive ever leaves the browser.

This is useful if you want full visibility into UI behavior while keeping user content and data completely private.

## How to enable Private Mode

You can enable Private Mode at the tracker level when initializing OpenReplay.

#### Using NPM

```js
import { tracker } from '@openreplay/tracker'

tracker.configure({
    projectKey: PROJECT_KEY,
    privateMode: true
})
tracker.start();
```

When `privateMode` is set to `true`, the following will be obscured:

- All visible text on the page  
- `alt` attributes on images  
- `placeholder` values in inputs  
- Label texts  

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/images/javascript-sdk/private-mode.png" alt="Private Mode" style={{ width: '700px', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

- Network requests (URLs, payloads, headers)  
- Console logs

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/images/javascript-sdk/private-mode-network.png" alt="Private Mode" style={{ width: '700px', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

No additional setup is required. Once enabled, the session will record layout and interaction—but none of the content.


## When to use it

Use `privateMode` if:

- You need to ensure complete user data privacy
- You’re testing OpenReplay in a **cloud environment**, but plan to **self-host it later**, and **cannot send any real data out**
- You're working in regulated industries where **privacy comes first**
