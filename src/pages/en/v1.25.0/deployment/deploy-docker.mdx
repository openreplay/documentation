<Aside type="tip">
	This is an experimental feature and its implementation may evolve in the future. OpenReplay cannot run in local, so even with Docker you'd still need a server. Consider our other [deployment options](/deployment).
</Aside>

OpenReplay stack can be installed on a single machine with Docker Compose. 

## Pre-requisites

1. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (LTS version is recommended)
2. Public IP Attached to the machine. Means your server is reachable from the Internet.
3. You should have a domain name attached to the ip address.
4. Choose your instance type. The minimum specs are `2 vCPUs, 8 GB of RAM, 50 GB of storage`, anond an x86 architecture, otherwise OpenReplay backend services won't simply start. So, we recommend **at least** the `t3.large` (or an equivalent), which is enough for a low/moderate volume. If you're expecting high traffic, you should scale from here.

## Deploy OpenReplay

```bash
## From your terminal
SSH_KEY=~/Downloads/openreplay-key.pem #! wherever you've saved the SSH key
INSTANCE_IP=REPLACE_WITH_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP
chmod 400 $SSH_KEY
ssh -i $SSH_KEY ubuntu@$INSTANCE_IP
```

2. Install OpenReplay by providing the domain on which it will be running (e.g. DOMAIN_NAME=openreplay.mycompany.com):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openreplay/openreplay/main/scripts/docker-compose/docker-install.sh)"
```

You're all set now, OpenReplay should be securely accessible on the domain you created first. You can create an account by visiting the `/signup` page (i.e. openreplay.mycompany.com/signup).
