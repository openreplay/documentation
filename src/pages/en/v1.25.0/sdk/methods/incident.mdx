By marking these incidents, you can easily identify and analyze them within the session replay.

## Signature

// call incident function and pass label, startTime, and endTime (label and endTime are optional)
incident({ label: 'incident', startTime: Date.now() - 1000, endTime: Date.now() })

## Parameters

- `label: string`: The name of the marked event.
- `startTime: number`: Timestamp signaling event start.
- `endTime: number` : Timestamp of end of the event.
