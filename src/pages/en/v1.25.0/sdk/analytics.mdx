## Analytics SDK

Learn how to set up the OpenReplay tracker analytics SDK.

## Modules

- [People](/sdk/analytics/people): Manage user profiles and attributes.
- [Events](/sdk/analytics/events): Track and analyze user interactions and events.

To learn more about managing your analytics data in the OpenReplay UI, visit [Data Management](/product-analytics/data-management).

## Top-level signatures

```ts
// Identify a user with an id (e.g. email, username, etc.)
tracker.analytics.identify(userId: string): void
// same as
tracker.analytics.people.identify()

// Add event to batch with option to send it immediately
tracker.analytics.track(eventName: string, tempProperties?: Record<string, any>, options?: { send_immediately: boolean })
// same as
tracker.analytics.events.track()
```
