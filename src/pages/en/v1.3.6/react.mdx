Getting the tracker to work on a React application is quite straightforward. 

## Adding the tracking code

While you can [get a copy&paste version of the code directly from the platform when you create a new project](/using-or/snippet#getting-the-snippet), that code is too barebone and will make it a lot harder to customize and add extra plugins.

Assuming you're building a SPA (Single Page Application), all you have to do, is to add the following code to your entry point:

```jsx
import Tracker from '@openreplay/tracker';

const tracker = new Tracker({
  projectKey: "<your project key>",  
});

function YourMainComponent({props}) {
    //some code here...

    useEffect(() => {
        tracker.start();
    }, [])

    return //....
}
```

In other words, you can instatiate the tracker at the start of the script, and once the page loads, you can start it using a `useEffect` hook.

<Aside type="tip">
**A note for self-hosted users**: if you're using the self-hosted version of OpenReplay, you'll also have to specify the `ingestPoint` configuration property. 
This property specifies the ingestion endpoint for the tracker’s data. Cloud users don’t need this, 
because by default the tracker will now where the SaaS version of this endpoint is, but if you’re self-hosting it, you’ll need to specify it 
(it should be something like `https://openreplay.mydomain.com/ingest`) 
</Aside>

### Handling the "projectKey" in your code

As a note, the `projectKey` that you configure is the one provided by OpenReplay’s platform. This value should not be stored hardcoded in your code for security reasons, but rather on some kind of configuration file/sytem.

There are different options out there to solve this problem, depending on your setup, you could use something like [`create-react-app` support for ENV variables](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/).

## Building something more complex?
If you're building a complext applicaton with React, chances are you're using [Next](/using-or/next), [Remix](/using-or/remix) or something like those. Make sure to check out our [Setup section](/using-or) to find the framework you're working with.

## Have questions?
