Clips are **short, curated segments from session replays** that highlight key user interactions, technical issues, or behavioral patterns. They are selected using **embedding distances** and **session metadata**, allowing users to quickly find the most relevant moments without manually reviewing full sessions. Clips adapt dynamically to user preferences, improving over time through engagement feedback.

Each session replay is analyzed to identify key moments, ensuring that users get a curated selection of **five clips** per cycle. These clips highlight meaningful interactions based on user role, use case, and session metadata.

## How Clips Are Selected

1. Maps session content into a **multidimensional space** to identify similar interactions.
2. Analyzes **user engagement signals**, such as replays, shares, and analytics interactions.
3. Selects **key moments** based on session activity and behavioral data.

This approach ensures that users receive **the most relevant and insightful session highlights**, making session replays more intuitive and accessible.
