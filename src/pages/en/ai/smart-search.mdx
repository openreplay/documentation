Smart Search is an AI-powered search feature in OpenReplay that enables users to write natural language queries and receive relevant session filters instantly. This helps users find specific sessions without manually browsing through large datasets.

**Availability:** Currently, Smart Search is only available for **Cloud (Serverless) users**. In the future, **Private Cloud Compute** will allow Self-hosted and Dedicated Cloud users to access this feature.

## How to Access Smart Search
1. Navigate to the **Session Replays** list view.
2. Click on the **Smart Search bar** at the top.
3. Type your query in natural language (e.g., *“Find sessions with console errors”*).
4. The AI will automatically generate relevant filters to narrow down the session results.
