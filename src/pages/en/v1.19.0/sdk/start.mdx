metaDescription: "Details about the 'start' method from OpenReplay's SDK"
---

This method is used to start the tracker. By starting the tracker, the recording of the session starts.

## Signature

```js
start(startOpts?: Partial<StartOptions>): Promise<StartPromiseReturn>
```

### Parameters
The `start` method accepts an optional parameter where you can customize different aspects of the recording:
- `userID: string`: used to manually set the user ID to track it across sessions. This is a string value and it can be anything you want.
- `metadata: Record<string, string>`: manually set metadata values. Check the [Metadata section](/installation/metadata/) to learn more about this feature.
- `forceNew: boolean`: used to force a new session after page refresh. By default it's set to `false`, so after a refresh the session is kept.
- `sessionToken: string`: used for sticky sessions. Useful if you have a multi-site application or if you have to redirect the user outside and then back into your site (like to a payment gateway).
- `assistOnly: boolean`: launches tracker in assist-only mode which will skip sending session data to backend (EE edition feature)

### Return value

Once started, the method will return a promise with a session info object containing:
- `sessionID: string`: A string value representing the ID of the started session.
Starts the tracker (and the recording process) then returns a promise with session info (sessionID, sessionToken, userUUID).
