Dashboards in OpenReplay serve as your central hub for monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing your product's performance and user experience. Whether you're debugging issues, tracking user behavior, or measuring performance, dashboards provide the insights you need to make data-driven decisions.

OpenReplay dashboards bring together critical insights for every member of your team:

- **For developers:** Track technical issues like JavaScript errors, slow network requests, and performance problems in real-time.
- **For product managers:** Analyze user behavior, monitor conversion funnels, and understand the paths users take through your product.
- **For teams analyzing website performance:** Track key metrics such as most visited pages, traffic sources, and user demographics.

## Overview of Dashboards and available Cards 

When you create a dashboard, it starts as a blank slate, ready for you to customize. Dashboards are made up of **cards**, with each card displaying a specific metric or set of data. You can add, remove, or move cards around to organize your dashboard as needed.

Cards fall into three main categories:

## Common use cases  

Dashboards are flexible and can be adapted for various purposes. 

Here are a few examples:  

- **Analyze user behavior:** Use Trends and Journeys to understand how users interact with your product.  
- **Identify issues:** Monitor JS Errors, 4xx/5xx Requests, and Slow Network Requests to address performance problems.  
- **Understand traffic:** Track Top Pages, Referrers, and user demographics to see what's working and where improvements are needed.  

Create separate dashboards for specific goals, such as monitoring marketing campaigns or tracking technical performance. Dashboards can act as different views of your system and provide an integrated summary of what’s happening.
