This method allows you to set a user ID on the currently active session. This allows you to associate a user to the replay, which would allow you to filter and search sessions for one particular user.

## Signature

```js
import OR from '@openreplay/react-native'

// ...
OR.tracker.setUserID('id')
```


## Parameters

- `userID: String`: The ID of the user. This is a string and can be anything as long as it's a string and it allows you to uniquely identify a user within your system (i.e. email, database id, etc).

## Return value

This method doesn't return any values, the results will be visible in the OpenReplay platform.
