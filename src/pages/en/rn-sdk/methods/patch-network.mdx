metaDescription: "Details about the patchNetwork method from OpenReplay's React Native SDK"
---

This method patches XHR and Fetch apis to intercept network requests.

## Signature

```js
import OR from '@openreplay/react-native'

OR.patchNetwork(
    global,
		(url) => url.includes('openreplaydomain'),
    { mode: 'fetch' }
)
```

## Parameters

- `context: globalThis`: current context of the app (to get fetch/xhr from)
- `isServiceURL: (url: string) => boolean`: function that checks if current request should be tracked (false) or skipped (true)
- `options: Partial<Options>`: options object

## Options

- `ignoreHeaders: Array<string> | boolean`: headers to ignore (default: `['cookie', 'set-cookie', 'authorization']`)
- `capturePayload: boolean`: whether to capture request payload (default: `false`)
- `sanitizer: data: RequestResponseData) => RequestResponseData`: function that sanitizes request/response (default: `undefined`)
- `mode: 'fetch' | 'xhr' | 'all'`: which api to patch (default: `'fetch'`)

> Note: React-Native fetch are using XHR under the hood (at the moment of writing), so using "all" can lead to duplicated requests in the recording
