## Hosting OpenReplay with other applications using reverse proxy

When OpenReplay is running in a machine, it'll use port 80/443 to expose the application. But when you're using a reverse proxy, OpenReplay can be configured to use another port to access the application. Below are the steps on how to do that:

1. Edit config file:

```bash
openreplay -e
```

2. Change the nginx config section:

```yaml
ingress-nginx: &ingress-nginx
  controller:
	...
	...
    service:
      externalTrafficPolicy: "Local"
      ports:
        http: 880   # Change this port for http
        https: 8443 # Change this port for https
```
3. Save and exit the config using `:wq` so OpenReplay can reload the configuration.

Your reverse proxy can then be configured. Refer to the below sections to do so.

### NGINX settings

Make sure your proxy is sending the `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers. SSL must also be enabled for OpenReplay to work. The rest of the config should look like this:

```nginx
location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_pass http://1.2.3.4:880; # replace with OpenReplay instance IP
    }
```

### Apache2 settings

Ensure `proxy`, `proxy_http` and `proxy_html` modules are enabled. SSL too should be configured, the rest of the settings should be similar to this:

```
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ProxyPass / http://1.2.3.4:880 <!-- replace with instance IP -->
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto expr=%{REQUEST_SCHEME}
    # SSL + other config here
</VirtualHost>
```

## Public endpoints

In case you're protecting your OpenReplay instance with a proxy, ensure the below endpoints are publicly accessible for OpenReplay to work properly.

| Endpoint | Description | Originator |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| /ingest | For ingesting events and recordings coming from your app | Your tracked app(s) (if publicly accessible then this endpoint should be public too) |
| /ws-assist | For live session replays with end users (WebSocket) | Your tracked app(s) (if publicly accessible then this endpoint should be public too) |
| /api | For authentication and fetching of sessions, projects, RBAC and account data | OpenReplay Dashboard |
| /v2/api | For search, analytics, session replay and co-browsing | OpenReplay Dashboard |
| /spots | For pulling spot videos from the object storage | OpenReplay Dashboard |
| /spot | For fetching data related to spot recordings | Spot Chrome Extension |
| /mobs | For pulling session replays from the object storage | OpenReplay Dashboard |
| /sessions-assets | For pulling cached stylesheets and fonts from the object storage | OpenReplay Dashboard |
| /static | For pulling data related to co-browsing sessions | OpenReplay Dashboard |
| /records | For pulling co-browsing recordings from object storage | OpenReplay Dashboard |
| /integrations | For fetching logs from 3-rd party integrations (like Sentry or Datadog) | OpenReplay Dashboard |
| /sourcemaps | For uploading sourcemaps | Sourcemaps CLI |
| /script | Useful if you wish to serve the openreplay-*.js files from your setup (otherwise defaults to OpenReplay CDN) | Your tracked app(s) |
