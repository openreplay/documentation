## Hosting OpenReplay with other applications using reverse proxy

When OpenReplay is running in a machine, it'll use port 80/443 to expose the application. But when you're using a reverse proxy, OpenReplay can be configured to use another port to access the application. Below are the steps on how to do that:

1. Edit config file:

```bash
openreplay -e
```

2. Change the nginx config section:

```yaml
ingress-nginx: &ingress-nginx
  controller:
	...
	...
    service:
      externalTrafficPolicy: "Local"
      ports:
        http: 880   # Change this port for http
        https: 8443 # Change this port for https
```
3. Save and exit the config using `:wq` so OpenReplay can reload the configuration.

Your reverse proxy can then be configured. Refer to the below sections to do so.

### NGINX settings

Make sure your proxy is sending the `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers. SSL must also be enabled for OpenReplay to work. The rest of the config should look like this:

```nginx
location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_pass http://1.2.3.4:880; # replace with OpenReplay instance IP
    }
```

### Apache2 settings

Ensure `proxy`, `proxy_http` and `proxy_html` modules are enabled. SSL too should be configured, the rest of the settings should be similar to this:

```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ProxyPass / http://1.2.3.4:880 <!-- replace with instance IP -->
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto expr=%{REQUEST_SCHEME}
    # SSL + other config here
</VirtualHost>
```

## Public endpoints

In case you're protecting your OpenReplay instance with a proxy, ensure the below endpoints are publicly accessible for OpenReplay to work properly.

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| /ingest | For capturing events and recordings |
| /api | For pulling and managing user data |
| /assist | For live video/calls with end users (WebRTC) |
| /ws-assist | For live session replays with end users |
| /static/openreplay.js | JavaScript code that loads OpenReplay |
