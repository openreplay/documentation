Below is the policy (CSP) for allowing OpenReplay to record sessions.

```html
worker-src ‘self’ blob: https://*.openreplay.com; script-src ‘self’ https://*.openreplay.com;
```

Please note that the `worker-src` directive is not supported in Safari (and mobile Safari). Using it should not prevent OpenReplay from recording sessions.

<Aside type="tip">
 This is valid for OpenReplay Cloud offering, but CSP can also be enabled for your self-hosted installation. Check [here](/configuration/secure-or/#content-security-policy-csp) for more details.
