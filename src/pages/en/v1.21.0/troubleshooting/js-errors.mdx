This section lists the most encountered Javascript errors and reported by our community.

## Require() of ES module

This error (as well as one below) generally happens when you try to import the tracker inside serverside context (SSR, Nuxt, Next, Remix apps etc).

Fixing it requires ensuring that tracker is imported and run inside browser context, via dynamic imports, client components etc.

## ReferenceError: Navigator is not defined

Sometimes this error occurs when you try to import `tracker-assist` or `tracker-fetch` plugins, this happens because node is trying to build the page without `window` API in the env.

The fix is fairly simple. All you have to do is to change the regular import of the trouble-causing plugin:

```js
import trackerAssist from '@openreplay/tracker-assist/cjs';
```

To dynamically import inside `componendDidMount` or `useEffect` alternative:

```js
import Tracker, { Options } from "@openreplay/tracker";
const tracker = new Tracker({ /* your options */ });

class TrackerComponent extends React.Component {

  componentDidMount = () => {
    import(‘@openreplay/tracker-assist/cjs’).then(({ default: trackerAssist }) => {
      tracker.start(/* your options */)
      tracker.use(trackerAssist(/* your assist options */))
    })
   }

 /* Other code */
```

This way all window API dependant plugins will be imported when the component gets rendered.

## Critical dependency: the request of a dependency is an expression

This may happen with old versions of `tracker-assist` plugin. You should apply this [workaround](https://github.com/peers/peerjs/issues/630#issuecomment-910028230) if you face the below error when compiling:

```log
Failed to compile.

./node_modules/peerjs/dist/peerjs.min.js
Critical dependency: the request of a dependency is an expression
```

## Uncaught DOMException: Blocked a frame with origin "X" from accessing a cross-origin frame

OpenReplay tracker captures **same-domain** iFrames by default. However, it throws an error when it tries to capture an iFrame that's NOT from the same-domain as your website. You can either:

- Disable the entire functionality using the `captureIFrames` property as in the example below: 

```js
const tracker = new OpenReplay({
      projectKey: PROJECT_KEY,
      captureIFrames: false
});
```

- Keep capturing iFrames (default behavior) by adding the `data-openreplay-capture` HTML attribute to the same-domain `<iframe>` tags **only**. This way, cross-origin iFrames won't be tracked by OpenReplay.
