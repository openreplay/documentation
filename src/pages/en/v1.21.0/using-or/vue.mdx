Getting the tracker to work on a Vue application is quite straightforward. 

## Adding the tracking code

While you can [get a copy&paste version of the code directly from the platform when you create a new project](/using-or/snippet#getting-the-snippet), that code is too barebone and will make it a lot harder to customize and add extra plugins.

Assuming you're building a SPA (Single Page Application), all you have to do, is to add the following code to your setup script in your main file.

```html
<script setup>
//... your code here
const tracker = new Tracker({
  projectKey: "<your project key>"
});

tracker.start();
//... more code here
</script>
```


<Aside type="tip">
**A note for self-hosted users**: if you're using the self-hosted version of OpenReplay, you'll also have to specify the `ingestPoint` configuration property. 
This property specifies the ingestion endpoint for the tracker’s data. Cloud users don’t need this, 
because by default the tracker will now where the SaaS version of this endpoint is, but if you’re self-hosting it, you’ll need to specify it 
(it should be something like `https://openreplay.mydomain.com/ingest`) 
</Aside>

### Handling the "projectKey" in your code

As a note, the `projectKey` that you configure is the one provided by OpenReplay’s platform. 
This value should not be stored hardcoded in your code for security reasons, but rather on some kind of configuration file/sytem.

One option would be to add an environment variable into a `.env` file in the root of your project and prefix the variable with `VITE_`, that will make it available to you in your Vue code.
You can use it later using `import.meta.env.<your variable name>`.
Like this:

```javascript
const tracker = new Tracker({
  projectKey: import.meta.env.VITE_VUE_APP_PROJECT_KEY,
});
 ```

## Building something more complex?
If you're building a complext applicaton with Vue, chances are you're using [Nuxt](/using-or/nuxt) or something like it. Make sure to check out our [Setup section](/using-or) to find the framework you're working with.

## Have questions?

If you have any issues setting up the tracker on your Vue project, please reach out to us on our [Slack community](https://slack.openreplay.com/) and ask our devs directly!
