If you're looking to add the tracker into your web application and you're using a framework that we don't support or you're just
using VanillaJS, you can directly add our JavaScript snippet.

## Getting the Snippet

The JavaScript snippet that you'll need to get the job done is provided to you when you setup the project on the OpenReplay portal.
Once you've added your new project, you'll see something like this:

![New project ready](./images/snippet/new-project-ready.png)

Once you see that, click on the "Complete Project Setup" button. 
That should take you to a page where you're presented with the JS Snippet:

Now, simply click on the "Script" tab and you'll see the actual JavaScript snippet:

![The snippet is visible](./images/snippet/snippet-visible.png)

Get the script and add it directly inside your `<head>` tag and the tracker will start working automatically.

<Aside type="tip">
Keep in mind that if you change any data recording options on step 1 from the screenshot above, the final snippet will change.
So make sure you first configure your recording options and then copy the actual snippet.

If you have any issues setting up the tracker using the JavaScript snippet, please reach out to us on our [Slack community](https://slack.openreplay.com/) and ask our devs directly!
