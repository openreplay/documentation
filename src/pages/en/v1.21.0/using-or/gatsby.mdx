Installing the OpenReplay tracker into a Gatsby-based project is relatively straightforward.

Considering that Gatsby is using React underneath, all we have to do, is to add the tracker code inside the main page and call the `start` method using the `useEffect` hook. 

Letâ€™s take a look.

## Why set up the Tracker on a static site?

The lack of dynamic content inside your app doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t want to take advantage of some of the other features of OpenReplay.

While you wonâ€™t be using the session replays to find bugs, youâ€™ll be able to capture interesting metrics and create [your own custom dashboards](https://docs.openreplay.com/tutorials/custom-dashboard) around these metrics.

You can use performance, web vitals and even resource-related metrics to get an overall idea of what the experience of your users is with your site.

## Setting up the Tracker inside Gatsby

Given a static Gatsby site and the entry point for it being the `index.tsx` file inside the `pages` folder, youâ€™d want to add the following code to it:

```jsx
import Tracker from '@openreplay/tracker';
const tracker = new Tracker({
  projectKey: process.env.GATSBY_OPENREPLAY_PROJECT_KEY
});

const Index = ({data, location }) => {

  React.useEffect(() => {
    tracker.start();
  }, [])

   //the rest of your code here...
}
```

The tracker gets instantiated when the page gets compiled (whether itâ€™s SSR or client-side rendering), but the start method can only be called from the browser, so we need to make sure it gets called after the component is mounted (thus the `useEffect` hook here). The empty array as the second argument of the `useEffect` hook makes sure the callback gets executed only once.

ðŸ’¡**A note for self-hosted users:** if youâ€™re using the self-hosted version of OpenReplay, youâ€™ll also have to specify the `ingestPoint`configuration property when instantiating the tracker. This property specifies the ingestion endpoint for the trackerâ€™s data. Cloud users donâ€™t need this, because by default, the tracker will know where the SaaS version of this endpoint is, but if youâ€™re self-hosting it, youâ€™ll need to specify it (it should be something like `https://openreplay.mydomain.com/ingest`)

## Handling the ENV variable in Gatsby

As a measure of security, we recommend not hardcoding the project key inside your code. That means youâ€™ll have to export it as an ENV variable so that Gatsby read it.

The OpenReplay project key will then live inside a variable named `GATSBY_OPENREPLAY_PROJECT_KEY`

Notice how the name is prefixed with `GATSBY_`  that will tell Gatsby to make sure the variable is available in front-end code as well. Otherwise, you wonâ€™t be able to read the value unless youâ€™re executing Node.js code.
