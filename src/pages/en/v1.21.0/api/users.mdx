## Get user stats

Get some high-level statistics and details about a particular user, who has been identified via the `tracker.setUserID` JavaScript function. This endpoint returns things like `firstSeen`, `lastSeen` and `numberSessions`.

### Method
`GET`

### URL
`/api/v1/:projectKey/users/:userId`

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| projectKey | string | The ID of the project you're tracking (required) |
| userId | string | The ID of your user, set via `tracker.setUserID` (required) |

### Request Headers

`Authorization: {YOUR_ORGANIZATION_API_KEY}`: The key can be found in 'Preferences' > 'Account' > 'Organization API Key'.

### Status Codes

`200`: Response sent as JSON in body

### Example Request

```shell
curl -X GET \
  https://openreplay.example.com/api/v1/3sWXSsqHgSKnE87YkNJK/users/mickael@openreplay.com \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: {YOUR_ORGANIZATION_API_KEY}'
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "userId": "mickael@openreplay.com",
    "sessionCount": 3,
    "lastSeen": 1623689478617,
    "firstSeen": 1623440822825
  }
}
```

## Delete user

Delete a user (identified via the `tracker.setUserID` JavaScript function) and all its data captured by OpenReplay. This fires up a background 1-time-job for removing all user related data, including sessions, events, metadata, custom events and recordings. The call returns a `jobID` that you can use later on to [check](/api/jobs#getjobdetails) the status of the delete operation.

This comes in handy for handling GDPR requests you may receive from your end users.

<Aside type="note">
	The delete-job will remove a maximum of 1000 random session associated to the specified user.

| userId | string | The ID of your user, set via `tracker.setUserID` (required) |

### Request Headers

### Change the replay-file delete time ? 

The deletion job is a 2 step process: First, sessions and their cascading events get deleted from the database overnight. Second, replay files are scheduled to expire (in 30 days) in the object storage.

If you're using minio (vanilla installation), and you wish to change the default expiry/lifecycle policy, follow the below instructions:
1. In your server, run `openreplay -e`
2. Under the `chalice` section, define a new env variable called **SCH_DELETE_DAYS** with a value equal to the number of days you want to keep the replay file before delete (greater or equal to 0)
3. Save and quit using `:wq`
4. Run `k9s -n db`
5. Use the keyboard arrows to navigate the list and get to the `minio-*` container
6. Press `s` to have shell access the Minio (object storage) container
7. Run `mc alias set minio http://localhost:9000 $MINIO_ACCESS_KEY $MINIO_SECRET_KEY`
8. To delete replay files 14 days after the delete-job execution

```bash
export EXPIRATION_DAYS=14
mc ilm add --expiry-days $EXPIRATION_DAYS --tags "to_delete_in_days=${EXPIRATION_DAYS}" minio/mobs
```

9. Use `exit` to exit the Minio container
10. Run `:quit` to exit the Kubernetes CLI
