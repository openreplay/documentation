## UI Components

Sanitized views will be blurred out in the resulting replay. You can add any UI component and it will be automatically removed (to preserve memory) as soon as its not on screen.

### ORSanitizedView

SDK exports `ORSanitizedView` which you can use to wrap your sensitive components with to blur them out.

```js
import OR from '@openreplay/react-native'

// ... your app UI

  <OR.ORSanitizedView>
    <SensitiveComponent />
  </OR.ORSanitizedView>

// ...
```
