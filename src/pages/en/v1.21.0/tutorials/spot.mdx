## How to use the Spot Chrome extension

Here’s how to use the Spot Chrome extension’s key features:

### Record tab

- **Start recording:** Click the Spot icon in your toolbar and select **Record Tab** to capture everything in the active tab.
- **Enable microphone:** If needed, toggle on the microphone option to include audio in your recording.
- **Pause recording:** Click on the pause icon from the recording panel at any time.
- **Restart recording:** Click on the restart icon from the recording panel to restart the recording.
- **Stop recording:** Click on the stop icon from the recording panel to stop the recording.
- **Add comments:** You can add comments to provide additional context before saving.
- **Save Spot:**  After stopping the recording, it will automatically save with all the relevant technical details, like console logs and network data.

  <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}> 
    <img src="./images/spot/record_tab.gif" alt="Use Record Tab feature" style={{ width: '600px', height: 'auto' }} />
  </div>

### Record desktop

- **Start recording:** Click the Spot icon and select **Record Desktop**. Choose to record your entire screen or a specific window.

### Access DevTools information in Spot recordings

Spot automatically includes DevTools data in every bug recording, providing your developers with complete context to efficiently debug issues. Each recording captures the following:

- **Console logs:** All console outputs, warnings, and error messages during the recording session.
- **Network requests:** Logs of all network activity, including:
  - **Request and response headers and bodies:** Data sent and received in each request.
  - **Status codes:** Quickly identify failed or problematic requests.
- **User agent data:** Information about the user's browser and device to help developers replicate the environment where the bug occurred.
- **User interaction data:** Details about user activity, such as clicks and navigation paths, allowing developers to understand how the issue was encountered.

**_Note on GraphQL errors_**

GraphQL typically returns a 200 OK status code for all responses, even when errors are present in the response body (usually placed inside an errors field). This can make it difficult to spot issues based solely on the HTTP status code.

In Spot, we detect when a GraphQL response contains an `errors` object in the body. When such an error is found, we mark the request with a `400` status code instead of `200`. This adjustment makes it easier for developers to identify and debug problematic GraphQL requests.
