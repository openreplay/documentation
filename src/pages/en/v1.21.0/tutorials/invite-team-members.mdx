OpenReplay allows you to manage team members by inviting or removing them as needed. This article outlines the steps for managing your team members.

## Invite Team Members

To invite team members:

1. Navigate to **Preferences > Team** in the OpenReplay dashboard.
2. Click the **Add Team Member** button.
3. Fill in the user’s details:
   - **Full Name**
   - **Email Address**
4. (Optional) Check Admin Privileges if the user needs team and project management access.
5. (Enterprise Edition Only) Assign a role to define their project and feature access.
6. Click **Invite**.

1. **For Self-Hosted users**: Initial signup is limited to one user during setup. Additional users must be invited. Email invitations require SMTP configuration—without it, share invitation links manually. See our [SMTP guide](/configuration/configure-smtp).

2. **For Cloud (Serverless or Dedicated) users**: The account creator has the role of **Owner** with Admin privileges. New members join as standard Members, but can be granted **Admin Privileges**. All invited team members automatically receive email invitations when added

## Remove Team Members

To remove a team member:

1. Navigate to **Preferences > Team** in the OpenReplay dashboard.
2. Locate the user in the team list.
3. Click the **Edit** icon next to their name.
4. Click the **Delete** icon.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/tutorials//invite-users/remove_user.gif" alt="Add Spot to Chrome" style={{ width: '600px', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

> **Note:** Admin Privileges are required to remove users.
