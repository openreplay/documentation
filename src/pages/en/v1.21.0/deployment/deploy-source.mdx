OpenReplay can be deployed from source. Its main components (Backend, API and Frontend) need to be built and pushed to your own container registry, before doing the installation.

The minimum specs for the machine running OpenReplay are `2 vCPUs, 8 GB of RAM, 50 GB of storage`, otherwise OpenReplay backend services won't simply start. This should be enough for a low/moderate volume. If you're expecting high traffic, you should scale from here.

## 1. Prerequisites

1. Install docker:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
user=`whoami`
sudo chown $user /var/run/docker.sock
```

2. Clone OpenReplay repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openreplay/openreplay
```

## 2. Build Backend services

1. Login to your container registry using `docker login <registry_url>`. If you have a docker hub account, then simply run `docker login`.

2. Build the backend components then push them to your container registry:

```bash
cd openreplay/backend
sudo IMAGE_TAG=<my_tag_number> PUSH_IMAGE=1 DOCKER_REPO=index.docker.io/<username> bash build.sh 
```

*Note* that the tag name can be any string you want, it'll be created on your Docker Registry and it'll be used to identify this particular version of the code (useful if you're also modifying the code).

If everything goes well, you should have, in your Docker registry, a list of images built from the source code you had, ready to be installed.
The list of images is:

- Storage
- Sink
- Integrations
- HTTP
- Heuristics
- Ender
- DB
- Assets
- Alerts
- Chalice

## 3. Updates Images

1. Create your container registry secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret -n app docker-registry my-registry-secret \
        --docker-server=MY_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL \ # not required if docker hub
        --docker-username=MY_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USERNAME \
        --docker-password=MY_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD \
        --docker-email=no@email.local 
```

2. To use the components you just built and pushed to your container registry, update the `vars.yaml` file, located inside the `openreplay/scripts/helmcharts` folder. 
Just add a section for each image you have on your docker registry with the following information:

- `repository`: should point to MY_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL/COMPONENT_NAME (if you're using Docker Hub, use the `<username>/<component name>` format instead)
- `pullPolicy`: set to "Always"
- `tag`: the value of IMAGE_TAG used when building Backend and API
- `imagePullSecrets`: the container registry secret

Note that any image you don't reference inside the `vars.yaml` file will be deployed and installed from the **official repository** of OpenReplay, which means you won't have the version built from your source code.

Below is an example for the `alerts` service:

```yaml
alerts:
  image:
    repository: rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/foss/alerts
    pullPolicy: Always
    tag: "v1.4.2"
  imagePullSecrets: 
    - name: my-registry-secret
```

### Install OpenReplay

1. Open `vars.yaml` then edit:
- `domainName`: this is where OpenReplay will be accessible (i.e. openreplay.mycompany.com)

2. Install OpenReplay:

```bash
cd openreplay/scripts/helmcharts
helm upgrade --install databases ./databases -n db --create-namespace --wait -f ./vars.yaml --atomic
helm upgrade --install openreplay ./openreplay -n app --create-namespace --wait -f ./vars.yaml --atomic
```

If you ever modify the source code of the back-end services or the DB service, you'll have to  go back to step 3 and then run the above commands once again.

### Configure TLS/SSL

OpenReplay deals with sensitive user data and therefore requires HTTPS to run. This is mandatory, otherwise the tracker simply wouldn't start recording. Same thing for the dashboard, without HTTPS you won't be able to replay user sessions.

You must therefore bring (or generate) your own SSL certificate.

1. First, go to DNS service provider and create an `A Record`. Use the domain you previously provided during the installation step and point it to your machine using its public IP.

2. If you're bringing your own certificate, create Kubernetes SSL secret using the following command: `kubectl create secret tls openreplay-ssl -n app --key="private_key_file.pem" --cert="certificate.crt"`.

> **Note:** If you don't have a certificate, generate one, that auto-renews, for your subdomain (the one provided during installation) using Let's Encrypt. Run `cd openreplay/scripts/helmcharts && bash certmanager.sh` and follow the steps.

3. If you wish to enable http to https redirection (recommended), then uncomment the below block, under the `ingress-nginx` section, in `vars.yaml`:
   
```yaml
ingress-nginx: &ingress-nginx
  controller:
    config:
      ssl-redirect: true
      force-ssl-redirect: true
```

It's worth mentioning that our `ingress-nginx` runs by default on ports `80|443`, but this can be easily changed, if needed, in `vars.yaml`:

```yaml
ingress-nginx: &ingress-nginx
  controller:
    service:
      ports:
        http: 80
        https: 443
```

4. Finally reinstall OpenReplay NGINX:

```bash
 openreplay -R
```

## 4. Build and deploy Frontend

Finally, if you're also looking to build the front-end, you'll have to build the image with the following line:

```bash
cd openreplay/frontend
IMAGE_TAG=<your tag> PUSH_IMAGE=1 DOCKER_REPO=myDockerHubID bash build.sh
```

Once this is done, go back to the `vars.yaml` file and add a section specific for the front-end, it should look similar to the ones you added before for `alerts` and `chalice`:

```yaml
frontend:
  image:
    repository: <YOUR DOCKER REGISTRY>/frontend
    pullPolicy: Always
    tag: <YOUR TAG>
  imagePullSecrets: 
    - name: <YOUR SECRET>
```

With the new section added on the file, execute the `openreplay -R` (which is located inside the `scripts/helmcharts` folder) command and your new front-end should be running.

You're all set now, OpenReplay should be accessible on your subdomain. You can create an account by visiting the `/signup` page (i.e. openreplay.mycompany.com/signup).
