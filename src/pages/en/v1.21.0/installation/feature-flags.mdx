---

Feature flags, also known as feature toggles, are a software development technique that allows developers to enable or disable functionality in their application without having to redeploy the code. Feature flags can be used for A/B testing and gradual rollouts, as a personalization feature or simply as a kill switch to quickly turn off certain features that cause bugs in production.

### Common flag interface

```js
interface IFeatureFlag {
  key: string
  is_persist: boolean
  value: string | boolean
  payload: string
}
```

### Tracker SDK

#### Options

```js
const tracker = new Tracker({
	projectKey: 'your. project key',
	// the rest of your tracker options
	flags: {
		onFlagsLoad: (flags: IFeatureFlag[]) => {
			// handle active flags
		},
	}
})
```

#### Methods

- `tracker.clearPersistFlags()` - Removes persistent Feature Flags from browser's sessionStorage.
- `tracker.reloadFlags(): Promise<void>` - Reloads all flags (can be useful if user session had any change of metadata, userId or any other information that could be required for certain flag conditions).
- `tracker.getFeatureFlag(flagKey: string)`: Returns a `IFeatureFlag` by key if eixsts.
- `tracker.getAllFeatureFlags()`: Returns all flags (`IFeatureFlag[]`) that are active right now.
- `tracker.isFlagEnabled(flagKey: string)`: Returns `true` if flag with this key does exist and is active.
- `tracker.onFlagsLoad(callback)`: Sets the callback to use when Feature Flags are loaded.
