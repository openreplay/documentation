This page explains how to sanitize UI components in your mobile applications using OpenReplay's SDKs for iOS and Android. For details on sanitizing network requests, refer to [Network Options (Mobile)](/network-options-mobile).

## iOS - Sanitizing UI Components

Sanitized views will be blurred out in the resulting replay. Components are automatically removed (to preserve memory) as soon as they are no longer visible.

### SwiftUI

Add the `.sensitive()` modifier to the component you wish to sanitize.

```swift
import ORTracker

Text("Sensitive Information")
    .sensitive()
```

### UIKit

Use the `addIgnoredView` method to mark a view as sensitive.

```swift
import ORTracker

ORTracker.shared.addIgnoredView(view)
```

### React Native

Wrap sensitive components with the `ORSanitizedView` component to blur them out in the replay.

```js
import OR from '@openreplay/react-native';

<OR.ORSanitizedView>
  <SensitiveComponent />
</OR.ORSanitizedView>
```

## Android - Sanitizing UI Components

Sanitized views are blurred out in the resulting replay and automatically removed from memory when off-screen.

### View

Mark a view as sensitive using the `addIgnoredView` method.

```kotlin
import com.openreplay.tracker.OpenReplay

OpenReplay.addIgnoredView(view)
```
