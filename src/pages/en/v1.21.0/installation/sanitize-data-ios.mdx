## Sanitizing UI Components

Sanitized views will be blurred out in the resulting replay. You can add any UI component and it will be automatically removed (to preserve memory) as soon as its not on screen.

### SwiftUI

Simply add `.sensitive()` modifier to desired component.

```swift
import ORTracker

Text("Very important sensitive text")
.sensitive()

```

### UIKit

```swift
import ORTracker

ORTracker.shared.addIgnoredView(view)
```

### React Native

SDK exports `ORSanitizedView` which you can use to wrap your sensitive components with to blur them out.

```js
import OR from '@openreplay/react-native'

// ... your app UI

  <OR.ORSanitizedView>
    <SensitiveComponent />
  </OR.ORSanitizedView>

// ...
```

## Sanitizing network requests

Two keys are exported to automatically trim the request/response data: `ignoredKeys` for body and `ignoredHeaders` for headers. Both, request and response will be sanitized, but body will only be affected if its a valid JSON.

Simply assign a list of strings that you would like to sanitize:

```swift
let networkListener = NetworkListener()
networkListener.ignoredHeaders = ["mySecretToken"]
networkListener.ignoredKeys = ["password"]
```

It is also possible to change the response data before passing it to the listener:

```swift
// ... request

var sanitizedData
if let data = data {
	do {
		let json = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: [])
		sanitizedData = customSanitizeFunction(data)
		print(json)
	} catch {
		print("Error deserializing JSON: \(error)")
	}
}

networkListener.finish(response: response, data: sanitizedData)
```
