metaDescription: "Details about the 'start' method from OpenReplay's SDK"
---

This method is used to start the tracker. By starting the tracker, the recording of the session starts.

## Signature

```js
start(startOpts?: Partial<StartOptions>): Promise<StartPromiseReturn>
```

### Parameters
The `start` method accepts an optional parameter where you can customize different aspects of the recording:
- `userID: string`: used to manually set the user ID to track it across sessions. This is a string value and it can be anything you want.
- `metadata: Record<string, string>`: manually set metadata values. Check the [Metadata section](/installation/metadata/) to learn more about this feature.
- `forceNew: boolean`: used to force a new session after page refresh. By default it's set to `false`, so after a refresh the session is kept.
- `sessionToken: string`: used for sticky sessions. Useful if you have a multi-site application or if you have to redirect the user outside and then back into your site (like to a payment gateway).
- `assistOnly: boolean`: launches tracker in assist-only mode which will skip sending session data to backend (EE edition feature)
- `startCallback?: (result: StartPromiseReturn) => void`: A callback triggered when the tracker starts or fails to start. Returns either success or failure information.


### Return value

Once started, the method will return a promise with a session info object containing:

- `sessionID: string`: A string value representing the ID of the started session.
- `sessionToken: string`: The token of the session.
- `userUUID: string`: A unique identifier for the user.

The `StartPromiseReturn` can be either:

```js
// Successful start
interface OnStartInfo {
  sessionID: string;
  sessionToken: string;
  userUUID: string;
}

const SuccessfulStart = (body: OnStartInfo): SuccessfulStart => ({
  ...body,
  success: true,
});

// Unsuccessful start
const UnsuccessfulStart = (reason: string): UnsuccessfulStart => ({
  reason,
  success: false,
});

// Type for start promise return
export type StartPromiseReturn = SuccessfulStart | UnsuccessfulStart;
```

- **Success case**: If successful, the promise will return sessionID, sessionToken, and userUUID.
- **Failure case**: If unsuccessful, it will return reason and success: false.
