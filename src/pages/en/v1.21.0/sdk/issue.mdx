This method can be used to report a "[technical event](/installation/custom-events)", otherwise known as an "issue". These issues can be used to report extra information regarding a problem that the tracker can't pick up by default. A good example of this would be the user trying to pay for a purchase on our e-commerce site and receving an error from the payment gateway. While the tracker could record the payload with the error, it would not identify it as a problem. This method lets you flag this behavior as an issue for further filtering of sessions.

  We also have a detailed tutorial on how to track custom events, you can check it out [here](/tutorials/custom-events).
