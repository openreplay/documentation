Begins buffering messages without starting the actual session. The buffer will keep the last 30 seconds of recorded events. You can activate the session by calling `start()` or via a conditional trigger.

## Signature

```ts
coldStart(startOpts?: Partial<StartOptions>, isConditional?: boolean): Promise<void>
```

### Parameters
With the `startOpts` you can customize different aspects of the recording:
- `userID: string`: Used to manually set the `userID` to track it across sessions. This is a string value and it can be anything you want.
- `metadata: Record<string, string>`: Manually set the metadata values. Check the [Metadata section](/installation/metadata/) to learn more about this.
- `forceNew: boolean`: Used to force a new session after page refresh. By default it's set to `false`, so after a refresh the session is kept.
- `sessionHash: string`: Used for sticky sessions. Useful if you have a multi-site application or if you have to redirect the user outside and then back into your site (like to a payment gateway).
- `isConditional`: Decides if the tracker should wait for the trigger condition to be met before starting the session automatically.

> Note: Conditional recording is only supported in our Cloud and Enterprise Edition offerings.

### Return value

This method does not return any value.
