**Journeys** help you analyze and understand how users navigate through your product. Whether it’s exploring the most common user flows, identifying unexpected behaviors, or analyzing drop-offs at key touchpoints, **Journeys** let you visualize the paths users take and gain deeper insights into their experience.

## Journeys use cases

**Journeys** help answer critical questions like:

- What are the most common paths users take after landing on a specific page?
- How do users navigate before reaching a checkout page?
- What are the typical steps users follow before dropping off?
- Are there unexpected paths leading to high conversions or drop-offs?
- How do mobile users navigate differently compared to desktop users?


## Getting started with Journeys

#### Create a new Journey

You can access **Journeys** within the **Cards** menu, under the category "Product Analytics." Select "Journeys" to begin setting up and analyzing user paths.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/images/products/product-analytics/journeys/journeys.gif" alt="journeys" style={{ width: '700px', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

#### Basic anatomy of Journeys

1. **Menu Bar:** Change the display layout, rename, delete, or add the Journey card to a dashboard.
2. **Chart area:** Visualize the most common user paths.
3. **Time range:** Adjust the time period to analyze specific trends.
4. **Events and filters:** Define starting and ending points by specifying visited URLs. Apply filters to refine the analysis based on user and session attributes and metadata.
5. **Sessions list:** View the list of user sessions that match the selected Journey.
