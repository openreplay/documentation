**Monitors** in OpenReplay provides a focused view of critical issues affecting your application's stability and performance. With preconfigured cards, you can monitor JavaScript errors, network requests, and other key metrics to quickly identify and address problems.

## What can you learn from Monitors?

With **Monitors**, you can answer questions like:

- What JavaScript errors are impacting the user experience?
- Which network requests are the most frequent in your application?
- Are there recurring client-side (4xx) or server-side (5xx) network requests?
- Which network requests are causing the most significant delays?

## Setting up your Monitors dashboard

Creating a dedicated Monitors dashboard helps you consolidate key metrics in one place, making it easier to stay on top of technical issues. Here’s how:

#### 1. **Create a dashboard**:
    1. Navigate to the **Dashboards** menu.
    2. Click **Add Dashboard** and name it **Monitors**.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/images/products/product-analytics/monitors/monitors.gif" alt="monitors" style={{ width: '700px', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

#### 2. **Add cards**:
    1. Navigate to the **Monitors** category.
    2. Add each of the following cards to your dashboard:
        - **Table of JS Errors:** Monitor JavaScript errors affecting user experience and quickly identify error types, frequencies, and affected users.
        - **Top Network Requests:** View the most frequent network requests and identify high-traffic API endpoints.
        - **Sessions with 4xx/5xx Requests:** Track client-side (4xx) and server-side (5xx) errors
        - **Sessions with Slow Network Requests:** pinpoint network requests causing delays and prioritize fixing slow APIs or overloaded services.

</div>

## Drill down insights from Monitors

Each card on the Monitors dashboard is interactive, allowing you to explore issues in greater detail:

### **Table of JS Errors**:

1. Click on an error to view its **stack trace**.
2. Use the **‘Find all sessions with this error’** button to locate all affected sessions.
3. Analyze trends with the **overview**, showing occurrences over the past 24 hours and 30 days.


### Sessions with 4xx/5xx and Slow Network Requests:

1. Select a point on the chart to view relevant session replays.
2. Open the **Network tab** in the session replay to analyze request details, including duration and statuses.
3. Adjust the time range for the chart using the dropdown to focus on specific periods.


### **Top Network Requests**:

- Review the most frequent requests in your application.
- Click on a specific request to filter sessions containing it and analyze further.

### **Adjusting the time range**

The default time range for your dashboard is the **past 24 hours**, but you can change it to better suit your needs:

1. Click on the **time range dropdown** at the top of the dashboard.
2. Choose a preset range (e.g., "Last 7 days") or set a custom time frame.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/images/products/product-analytics/monitors/monitors_time.png" alt="monitors" style={{ width: '700px', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

## **Alternative card creation**

If you prefer, you can create and add cards directly from the **Cards View**:

1. Navigate to **Cards View** in the Analytics module.
2. Create a card for any Monitors metric (e.g., JS errors or slow network requests).
3. Add the card to your Monitors dashboard using the **Add to Dashboard** option.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/images/products/product-analytics/monitors/monitors_card_to_dashboard.gif" alt="monitors" style={{ width: '700px', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

## **Make the most out of** Monitors

**Monitors** let you track and address critical issues like JavaScript errors, network performance, and slow requests. Use its interactive features, session replays, and the network tab to dive deep into problems, uncover root causes, and enhance your application's stability and performance.
