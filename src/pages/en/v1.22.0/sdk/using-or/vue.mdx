Getting the tracker to work on a Vue application is quite straightforward. 

## Adding the tracking code

Assuming you're building a SPA (Single Page Application), all you have to do, is to add the following code to your setup script in your main file.

```html
<script setup>
// note that you can manually import Tracker class if you want to handle the instance manually
import { tracker } from '@openreplay/tracker'
//... your code here
tracker.configure({
  projectKey: "<your project key>",
  ingestPoint: "https://openreplay.mydomain.com/ingest" // only required if using the self-hosted version of OpenReplay
});

tracker.start();
//... more code here
</script>
```

<Aside type="tip">
While you can get the [JS snippet version](/using-or/snippet#getting-the-snippet) of our tracker directly from our CDN when you create a new project, the code is too barebone and will make it harder to customize and add extra plugins.

### Handling the "projectKey" in your code

For security reasons, avoid hardcoding your `projectKey` directly in your application code. Instead, store it in a configuration file or environment system.

One option would be to add an environment variable into a `.env` file in the root of your project and prefix the variable with `VITE_`, that will make it available to you in your Vue code. You can use it later using `import.meta.env.<your variable name>`.

Here is an example:
```javascript
tracker.configure({
  projectKey: import.meta.env.VITE_VUE_APP_PROJECT_KEY,
});
 ```

## Building something more complex?

If you're building a complext applicaton with Vue, chances are you're using [Nuxt](/using-or/nuxt) or something like it. Make sure to check out our [Tracker Setup](/using-or) section to find the framework you're working with.

## Have questions?

If you have any issues setting up the tracker on your Vue project, please reach out to us on our [Slack community](https://slack.openreplay.com/)Â and ask our devs directly!
