Getting the tracker to work on a React application is quite straightforward. 

## Adding the tracking code

Assuming you're building a SPA (Single Page Application), all you have to do, is to add the following code to your entry point:

```jsx
import { tracker } from '@openreplay/tracker';

tracker.configure({
  projectKey: "<your project key>", 
  ingestPoint: "https://openreplay.mydomain.com/ingest" // only required if using the self-hosted version of OpenReplay
});

function YourMainComponent({props}) {
    //some code here...

    useEffect(() => {
        tracker.start();
    }, [])

    return //....
}
```

Alternatively, you can also use the `Tracker` class directly to handle its instance manually:

```jsx
import Tracker from '@openreplay/tracker';

const tracker = new Tracker({
  projectKey: "<your project key>",  
  ingestPoint: "https://openreplay.mydomain.com/ingest" // only required if using the self-hosted version of OpenReplay
});

function YourMainComponent({props}) {
    //some code here...

    useEffect(() => {
        tracker.start();
    }, [])

    return //....
}
```

In other words, you can instantiate the tracker at the start of the script, and once the page loads, you can start it using a `useEffect` hook.

<Aside type="tip">
While you can get the [JS snippet version](/using-or/snippet#getting-the-snippet) of our tracker directly from our CDN when you create a new project, the code is too barebone and will make it harder to customize and add extra plugins.

### Handling the "projectKey" in your code

For security reasons, avoid hardcoding your `projectKey` directly in your application code. Instead, store it in a configuration file or environment system.

Several approaches are available depending on your project setup:
- **Environment Variables**: If using Create React App, leverage its [built-in support for environment variables](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/)
- **Configuration Files**: Use dedicated config files that are excluded from version control
- **Environment Management**: Tools like `dotenv` can help manage different keys across environments

Below is an example:
```javascript
// Access the key from environment variables
const openReplayKey = process.env.REACT_APP_OPENREPLAY_KEY;
```

## Building something more complex?

If you're building a complex application with React, chances are you're using [Next](/using-or/next), [Remix](/using-or/remix) or a similar framework. Make sure to check out our [Tracker Setup](/using-or) section to find the framework you're working with.

## Have questions?

If you have any issues setting up the tracker on your React project, please reach out to us on our [Slack community](https://slack.openreplay.com/)Â and ask our devs directly!
