Tracker will listen to views appear/dissapear events.

## Adding tracked views

### SwiftUI

use `.observeView(title:viewName:)` to observe input events,

- `title: String` - screen or feature title
- `viewName: String` - name of the tracker view

```swift
import ORTracker

TextField("Input", text: $text)
 .observeView(title: "Screen title", viewName: "test input name")
```

### UIKit
```swift
import ORTracker

Analytics.shared.addObservedView(view: inputEl, title: "Screen title", viewName: "test input name")
```
