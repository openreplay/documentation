How to integrate Stackdriver with OpenReplay and see backend errors alongside session recordings.

## 1. Create Google Cloud Service Account

1. In the GCP Console, go to the [Create Service Account Key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey) page.
2. From the Service account list, select *New Service Account*.
3. In the Service account name field, enter "openreplay-stackdriver".
4. From the Role list, add *Logging > Logs Viewer* and *Stackdriver > Stackdriver Accounts Viewer*.
5. Click *Create* to download the JSON file that contains your key.

## 2. Enable Stackdriver in OpenReplay

Paste your `Log Name` and `openreplay-stackdriver` credentials in OpenReplay dashboard under 'Preferences > Integration'.

## 3. Propagate openReplaySessionToken

To link a Stackdriver event with the recorded user session, a unique token has to be propagated from your frontend to your backend on each request you want to track. This can be done using a custom HTTP header. In the below example, we use the `fetch` function to send that header.

```javascript
const headers = {
  Accept: 'application/json',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
};
if (tracker.getSessionToken()) { // or window.OpenReplay instead of tracker if you're using the snippet
  headers['X-OpenReplay-SessionToken'] = tracker.getSessionToken(); // Inject openReplaySessionToken
}
fetch('www.your-backend.com', {
  'GET',
  headers,
});
```

In order for OpenReplay to associate a Stackdriver log entry with the recorded user session, a unique token has to be propagated as a `label` to each backend error you wish to track.

Below is an example in Stackdriver's Python API.

```python
google_logger.log_text("A LOG ENTRY", severity='ERROR', labels={"openReplaySessionToken": OPENREPLAY_SESSION_TOKEN})

#or

google_logger.log_struct({"message": "A LOG ENTRY"}, severity='ERROR', labels={"openReplaySessionToken": OPENREPLAY_SESSION_TOKEN})
```

The name of the tag `openReplaySessionToken` is case sensitive.
