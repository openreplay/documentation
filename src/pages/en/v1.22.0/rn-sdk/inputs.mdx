Tracker will listen to value change event (debounced) and send resulting value to OpenReplay backend.

## Adding tracked inputs

SDK exports `ORTrackedInput` which you can use as regular TextInput components.

```js
import OR from '@openreplay/react-native'

// ... your app UI

  <OR.ORTrackedInput
    style={styles.input}
    onChangeText={onChangeNumber}
    value={number}
    placeholder="important placeholder"
  />

// ...
```
