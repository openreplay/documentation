## Installation

### Error: release openreplay failed, and has been uninstalled due to atomic being set

This might be because of failed helm installation. To debug, follow the below steps:

```bash
openreplay -s

# If you see any failed pods, check the log. it should shed some light.
openreplay -l <pod name>

# If there is no pods in running/error/crashloop status, then check the status of pod using following command
kubectl describe po -n app -n db <pod name>
```

## Signup is not working

### Health check shows SSL check failed
  
If you've a self-signed certificate, you can use the following command to fix it:

```bash
openreplay -e

# Add following line to skip the SSL health check
chalice:
  env:
    ...
    # append the following line under env section
    SKIP_H_SSL: true
```

Save and quit the config file using `:wq`

## My installation suddenly stopped working
   
There might be multiple reasons for that. Here's how you can debug the situation:

### Check the status of Installation, using `openreplay -s`

Check the disk usage section. If it's more than 80%, the services won't run.

## Upgrade failed without any particular error
   
### I see "helm or another operation (install/upgrade/rollback) is in progress"

This usually means that you retried the installation/upgrade operation multiple times. Run the below command to resolve the situation:

```bash
helm rollback -n app openreplay
```

### I see no errors, just "installation failed"

```bash
# Check for failed pods
kubectl get pods -n app --field-selector="status.phase!=Succeeded,status.phase!=Running" -o custom-columns="POD:metadata.name"
        
# Check for the err logs
openreplay -l `pod name from above`
 ```

## Self-Hosted Errors

### Error: You must be logged in to the server (Unauthorized)

`openreplay -s` or `kubectl get po` throws error `error: You must be logged in to the server (Unauthorized)`. k3s might have regenerated the client certificate for logging onto the cluster, but kubectl hadn't picked this up. Copy the new config with `cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config` and you're good to go.
