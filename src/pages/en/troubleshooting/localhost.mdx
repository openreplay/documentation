OpenReplay needs public access (HTTPS only) to your app's resources (CSS, fonts and icons) to properly render the recordings. We copy those resources so you can still replay your sessions even though your app's content has changed. Images are handled differently, they are retrieved in real-time when a session gets replayed.

For these reasons we recommend testing the installation on a publicly accessible environment (i.e. staging) rather than in localhost. There is still a workaround for local development even though it's not perfect: simply add the `inlineCss: 3` option to your [tracker constructor](/sdk/constructor/#stylesheets) so stylesheets will then be captured as part of each replay (instead of being centrally cached by the server). Session replays should be available afterwards in the dashboard, but they might be missing images as explained above.

> Note: You may also need to enable the `__DISABLE_SECURE_MODE: true` option to allow insecure connection between tracker and backend on sites without SSL.
