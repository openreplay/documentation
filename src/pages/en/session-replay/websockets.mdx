OpenReplay can record chosen WebSocket channels and display them in the session replay. This is useful when troubleshooting certain situations by providing additional context.

## Enable WebSockets Recording

To enable WebSockets recording, you will need to create a hook that will listen to messages:

```ts
const wsHook = tracker.trackWs('my_ws_channel')

myWsChannel.on('important_message', (data) => {
  wsHook('important_message', data, 'down')
  /** your code */
})
myWsChannel.onAnyOutgoing((event, data) => {
  wsHook(event, data, 'up')
})
```

Example built with [socket-io docs](https://socket.io/docs/v4/listening-to-events/)

> Note: This is just a basic example, make sure to read how to listen to message events and plan what you actually need to capture accordingly. Big/heavy traffic will lead to bigger replay sizes.

### Data Sanitization

You can sanitize data before it is sent via hook.
