metaDescription: "Group multiple events into reusable Actions to simplify session search, dashboards and user analytics in OpenReplay."
---

Actions let you group one or more events into a single, named unit that you can reuse across OpenReplay. Instead of repeatedly picking the same set of events, create an Action once and reference it everywhere — in [session search](/session-replay/search), [dashboards](/product-analytics/dashboards) and other sections.

## What is an Action?

An Action is a named collection of events (auto-captured or custom) with an optional description. For example, you might create an Action called **Signed Up** that combines multiple inputs, a `form_submitted` event on the signup page and a `registration_complete` custom event.

## Creating an Action

1. Navigate to **Product Analytics → Data Management → Actions**.
2. Click **Create Action**.
3. Give it a name and an optional description.
4. Add one or more events — pick from auto-captured or custom events.
5. Save.

## Using Actions

Once created, Actions can be used in place of individual events across OpenReplay:

- **Session Search** — filter sessions by Action to find recordings where users performed a specific workflow.
- **Dashboards** — add Actions as metrics in widgets to track adoption or conversion without rebuilding event filters each time.
- **User Analytics** — segment users based on whether they triggered an Action during a given period.
