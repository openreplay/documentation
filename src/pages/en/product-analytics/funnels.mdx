**Funnels** are designed to help you analyze and understand how users navigate through key steps in your product. Whether it's tracking sign-up flows, checkout processes, or onboarding completion, funnels let you visualize the journey and pinpoint where users drop off.

## Funnel use cases

**Funnels** help answer critical questions like: 

- How many users complete each step of the checkout process?
- Where do users drop off during onboarding?
- What is the drop-off rate between step X and step Y in the sign-up process?
- Which steps in the onboarding process cause the most drop-offs?
- Are mobile users dropping off at a specific step compared to desktop users?

## Getting started with Funnels

#### Create a new Funnel

You can access Funnels within the Cards menu, under the category "Product Analytics." Select "Funnels" to begin setting up and analyzing funnel steps.

</div>

#### Basic anatomy of Funnels

1. **Menu Bar:** Change the display layout, rename, delete, or add the funnel card to a dashboard.
2. **Chart area:** Visualize total conversions, conversions between steps, and users who skipped steps. See the total conversion and lost conversion through the entire funnel.
3. **Time range:** Adjust the time period to analyze specific trends.
4. **Events and filters:** Define events for each funnel step, combining user actions such as clicks, visited URLs, and inputs. Filters are applied across all defined events.
5. **Sessions list:** Click on grayed-out sections to view sessions of users who dropped off at a particular step, and play replays to identify root causes.

</div>

## Visualizing Funnels: chart types

1. **Funnel bar chart:** Best for visualizing step-by-step progression and drop-offs.
2. **Funnel column chart:** Provides a vertical view of conversions and drop-offs.
3. **Metric:** Highlights the overall conversion rate.
4. **Table:** Displays detailed numbers for each step, including total sessions or users and overall conversion rate.

</div>

## Customizing Funnel views

#### Adjusting the Time Range

</div>

#### Comparison tools

- Compare funnel performance to previous periods, such as:
    - Previous Day
    - Previous Week
    - Previous Month
    - Previous Quarter
    - Custom Ranges

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/images/products/product-analytics/funnels/funnels_compare.png" alt="funnels" style={{ width: '700px', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

</div>

## Advanced capabilities

#### Events and Filters

- Combine multiple events such as clicks, text inputs, visited URLs, and tagged elements to define funnel steps.
- Apply filters across all events to focus on user attributes (e.g., User ID, userAnanymousId) or session characteristics (e.g., duration, referrer, country, city, OS, Browser UTM Source..).

#### Interactive features

- **Session Drill downs:** Click on the grayed-out sections in the funnel chart to view sessions of users who dropped off at specific steps. Play session replays to identify issues and uncover root causes of drop-offs.
- **Conversion metrics:** Visualize the total conversion rate, step-by-step conversions, and lost conversions for the entire funnel.

#### Export options

- Save funnel visualizations as images for easy sharing with your team or stakeholders.
