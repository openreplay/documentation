Learn how to integrate [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) backend logs with [OpenReplay](https://www.openreplay.com/) session replays to extend your monitoring and debugging capabilities.

### 1. Create a New API Key

Depending on your setup, you can create an API key using the Kibana dashboard or via cURL commands.

**Using Kibana Dashboard**

1. Log in to your Kibana dashboard.

2. Access **Dev Tools**: Navigate to **Dev Tools > Console**.

3. Create **API Key**: Copy the following code into the console and run it:

     ```json
     POST /_security/api_key
     {
       "name": "openreplay-api-key",
       "role_descriptors": {
         "openreplay-role": {
           "cluster": ["all"],
           "index": [
             {
               "names": ["*log*"],
               "privileges": ["read"]
             }
           ]
         }
       }
     }
     ```

#### **Using cURL Commands**

1. Execute the cURL Command: Run the following command in your terminal:

     ```shell
     curl -X POST "https://your-elasticsearch-host:port/_security/api_key" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d'
     {
       "name": "openreplay-api-key",
       "role_descriptors": {
         "openreplay-role": {
           "cluster": ["all"],
           "index": [
             {
               "names": ["*log*"],
               "privileges": ["read"]
             }
           ]
         }
       }
     }' \
     -u 'username:password'
     ```

     Replace `https://your-elasticsearch-host:port` with your Elasticsearch host and port, and `username:password` with your credentials.

**Note:**

- By default, this integration will search for logs inside any index that matches `*log*`. If you have a specific index for logs that doesn't match this pattern, please change the `names` field in the API key creation request.
- To specify multiple indexes, separate the names with commas, e.g., `"names": ["index1", "index2"]`.

#### **API Key Result**

After running the command, you will receive a response like:

```json
{
  "id": "eQWAIG0Bo0VqB8HXFH9-",
  "name": "openreplay-api-key",
  "api_key": "dZ5ycVRJTU-5UW_RYfi1_w"
}
```

**Important:** Make sure to copy the `id` and the `api_key` as you will need them for the integration.

## 2. Configure Elasticsearch integration in OpenReplay
In your OpenReplay account, follow these 3 steps to complete the session replays correlations with Elasticsearch backend logs.

### Enable Elasticsearch integration
1. Go to **Preferences > Integrations** in OpenReplay.
2. Select the **Backend Logging** tab.
3. Select the project to which you want to enable the Elasticsearch integration: Locate the Elasticsearch integration card > Click on it.

### Enter Elasticsearch credentials
In the Elasticsearch integration sidebar enter:
   - **API KEY ID**: The `id` from the API key you generated.
   - **API Key**: The `api_key` from the API key you generated.
   - **Indexes**: If you changed the index when generating the API key, specify the name(s) here.

### Verify connection:
   - Click on **Add** to test the connection.


### 3. Propagate openReplaySession.id

To link an Elasticsearch event with the recorded user session, a unique session ID (`openReplaySession.id`) needs to be propagated from your frontend to your backend on each request you want to track.

#### **a. Include `openReplaySession.id` in Frontend API Requests**

**Note:** `tracker.start()` is asynchronous and returns a Promise. You need to wait for it to resolve before calling `tracker.getSessionID()` to ensure the session ID is available.

```javascript
// JavaScript Example for for Single Page Applications (SPA):

// Import OpenReplay
import { tracker } from '@openreplay/tracker';

// Initialize the tracker
tracker.configure({
  projectKey: 'YOUR_PROJECT_KEY',
});

// Start the tracker and wait for it to resolve
tracker.start().then(() => {
  // Get the session ID after the tracker has started
  const sessionId = tracker.getSessionID();

  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  };

  if (sessionId) {
    headers['openReplaySession.id'] = sessionId;
  }

  // Make the API request
  fetch('https://www.your-backend.com/api/endpoint', {
    method: 'GET', // or 'POST', 'PUT', etc.
    headers,
    // ...other options
  })
    .then(response => {
      // Handle response
    })
    .catch(error => {
      // Handle error
    });
});
```

#### **b. Include openReplaySession.id in Backend Logs**

In order for OpenReplay to associate an Elasticsearch log entry with the recorded user session, the `openReplaySession.id` must be included in each backend error you wish to track.


```python
import logging
from flask import Flask, request, g

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configure the root logger
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger()

# Create a custom logging filter
class OpenReplayFilter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record):
        session_id = getattr(g, 'openreplay_session_id', None)
        if session_id:
            record.msg = f"[openReplaySession.id={session_id}] {record.msg}"
        return True

# Add the filter to the logger
logger.addFilter(OpenReplayFilter())

@app.before_request
def before_request():
    # Extract the session ID from headers and store it in the Flask `g` object
    g.openreplay_session_id = request.headers.get('openReplaySession.id')

@app.route('/api/endpoint')
def api_endpoint():
    # Your logic here

    # Log an event with the session ID automatically included
    logger.info("Endpoint accessed")

    return 'Success', 200

@app.errorhandler(Exception)
def handle_exception(e):
    # Log the error with the session ID automatically included
    logger.error(f"Error: {str(e)}")
    return 'Internal Server Error', 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### 4. Special Considerations

By default, OpenReplay looks for each log associated with an OpenReplay session using the attributes `message` and `utc_time`. It focuses on error logs, identified by checking if the `tags` attribute contains the value `error`.

**Note:**

- **Custom Log Structure**: If your logs have a different structure, you may need to adjust your logging configuration or inform OpenReplay support to accommodate your setup.
- **Error Identification**: Ensure that error logs are appropriately tagged so that OpenReplay can identify them.
