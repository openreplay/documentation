OpenReplay can be deployed anywhere. Here are step-by-step tutorials for deployment options using all the major cloud providers.

## Step-by-step guides

- [AWS](/deployment/deploy-aws)
- [Google Cloud](/deployment/deploy-gcp)
- [Azure](/deployment/deploy-azure)
- [Digital Ocean](/deployment/deploy-digitalocean)
- [Scaleway](/deployment/deploy-scaleway)
- [OVHcloud](/deployment/deploy-ovhcloud)
- [Ubuntu](/deployment/deploy-ubuntu)
- [Kubernetes](/deployment/deploy-kubernetes)

You can also deploy from [source](/deployment/deploy-source). Even though this method takes more effort, it gives a lot of flexibility as you can use the latest code and customize it if needed.

## Admin

- [Administer OpenReplay](/deployment/openreplay-admin): For easy management of your instance by directly accessing logs, reinstalling services, increasing capacity and more.
- [Upgrade Deployment](/deployment/upgrade): Keep your OpenReplay instance updated by upgrading it to the latest version.
