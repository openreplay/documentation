How to integrate Sentry with OpenReplay and see backend errors alongside session recordings.

## 1. Generate Sentry Auth Token

Go to [Sentry > Account > API > Auth Tokens](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/) and generate the token with `event:read`, `org:read` and `project:read` permissions. This latter will be used in the next step when enabling your Sentry integration in OpenReplay dashboard.

## 2. Enable Integration in OpenReplay

Copy your `organization_slug` and `project_slug` from the **Projects** page in your Sentry dashboard.

![Projects Page in Sentry](../static/sentry-2.png#center)

![Sentry Integration Form in OpenReplay](../static/sentry-3.png#center)

Then paste them in OpenReplay dashboard under 'Preferences > Integration' alongside the Token you previously generated in step 1.

## 3. Propagate openReplaySessionToken

In order for OpenReplay to associate a Sentry event with the recorded user session, Sentry event should be tagged with unique token.  

### Frontend
If you're relying on Sentry on your frontend, you can follow the below example.

```javascript
import OpenReplay from "@openreplay/tracker";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

const tracker = new OpenReplay({
	projectKey: MY_PROJECT_KEY,
	onStart: ({ sessionToken }) => {
	  Sentry.setTag("openReplaySessionToken", sessionToken);
	},
})
```
Or in case of snippet: 
```javascript
if (window.OpenReplay.getSessionToken()) {
	Sentry.setTag("openReplaySessionToken", window.OpenReplay.getSessionToken());
}
```

### Backend

Otherwise, if you use Sentry SDK for backend, session token has to be propagated from your frontend on each request you want to track. This can be done using a custom HTTP header. In the below example, we use the `fetch` API to send that header.

```javascript
const headers = {
  Accept: 'application/json',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
};
if (tracker.getSessionToken()) { // or window.OpenReplay instead of tracker if you're using the snippet
  headers['X-OpenReplay-SessionToken'] = tracker.getSessionToken(); // Inject openReplaySessionToken
}
fetch('www.your-backend.com', {
  'GET',
  headers,
});
```

You can also use OpenReplay [Fetch Plugin](/plugins/fetch) to set the header automatically for each tracking request.

Then you can extract the `openReplaySessionToken` from the header and add it to your Sentry scope (ideally using a middleware or decorator).

```python
with configure_scope() as scope:
  scope.set_tag('openReplaySessionToken', app.current_request.headers.get('X-OpenReplay-SessionToken'))
```

The name of the tag should be exactly `openReplaySessionToken`.

## 4. Attach openReplaySessionURL (optional yet very useful)

If you wish to link the OpenReplay recording's URL with Sentry and display it as a tag, here is an example on how to do it:

```javascript
 const tracker = new OpenReplay({
 projectKey: window.OPENREPLAY_PROJECT_KEY,
 
 onStart: ({ sessionToken, sessionID }) => {
  // This is to link from OpenReplay -> Sentry
  Sentry.setTag("openReplaySessionToken", sessionToken);
 
  // This is to link from Sentry -> OpenReplay (requires tracker v3.6.0+)
  Sentry.setTag(
    "openReplaySessionURL",
    tracker.getSessionURL();
    );
  },
});
```
